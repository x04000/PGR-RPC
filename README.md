# Punishing: Gray Raven - Discord Rich Presence
# 🌟 How it works?
Easy! This app launches your PGR default launcher (if detected) and waits for you to open the game. When your game starts, the app will display the Discord activity. Every 10 seconds, the app will check if the game is running. If the game closes, it will stop the Discord presence and close this program. PGR RPC runs in the background.

# 🛠️ How to install
➡️ Just extract the zip file into your game folder (for example: C:\Punishing Gray Raven\). It must be placed in the same folder as "launcher.exe".

ℹ️ More info: This will create a folder called "PGRRPC" with 3 files. The main file is "Punishing Gray Raven" (you can rename it as you wish). You need to run this file every time you play (you can pin it to the start menu, taskbar, etc. if you like; I renamed it to "Punishing Gray Raven" for that reason :D). The application will automatically open the original PGR launcher if found.

❗ Note: If you extract the zip file into a different folder, the application will not open the PGR launcher (because it cannot find it). However, once the game opens, the Discord presence will still work properly.
